              <p class="intro-text">The Plotter Bot is designed to write down a word inputted by the user with a brush pen.</p>

              <p>C++ is used to produce a word file which contained the vector coordinate systems for each letter in the word. The word file is then interpreted by RobotC so that the word could be plotted by the robot. Lego EV3 kits are used as well as Tetrix Kits for the construction of the robot. Many different mechanical designs were carefully thought out and planned in order to come up with the final design. The process can be found in our interm report below. 3D printers were also utilized to create extra pieces for the plotter bot including lego racks and a pen holder.</p>

              <p>The interm report of where my team and I outlined our ideas and plans for the project is available <a href = "reports/IntermReport.pdf">here</a>. Also the final report where we explain the results of the project as well as our final program is available <a href = "reports/Final-Report.pdf">here</a>.</p>
